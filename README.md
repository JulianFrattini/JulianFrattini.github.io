```

### Development

To run the website locally, you need a Ruby setup with Jekyll installed.
Alternatively, you can use the [Devcontainer](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) setup.
This setup pulls a development environment with Ruby and Jekyll pre-installed.
The environment is specified in the [Dockerfile.dev](Dockerfile.dev) and automatically hosted at `ghcr.io/julianfrattini/julianfrattini.github.io-dev:latest` via the [docker-image-dev.yml action](.github/workflows/docker-image-dev.yml).

Once an appropriate environment is set up (e.g., by starting loading this project in its devcontainer environment), serve the website via the following command from the terminal: 

```
jekyll serve
```

The website will become available at localhost:4000.

### Configuration

The [README of the Hyde project](https://github.com/poole/hyde/blob/master/README.md) contains advise on how to customize the theme of the website.
