<p>This page lists the high-level initiatives that I pursue. Each initiative is characterized by an overarching goal to which individual publications contribute to.</p>

<h2>Good-Enough Requirements Engineering</h2>

<p><i>Good-enough requirements engineering</i> was the leitmotif during my <a href="{{ site.url }}/thesis">doctoral studies</a>. This initiative aims to provide software engineering pracitioners with decision support to answer the question "Are my requirements good enough?" In the scope of this initiative, we developed a theoretical foundation - the activity-based requirements quality theory (RQT) - and started contributing empirical evidence to the theory. Our goal is to collect evidence about the impact of requirements quality factors (e.g., the use of passive voice) on subsequent activities (e.g., implementing or testing).</p>

<h3>Reading List</h3>

<p>If interested in this initiative, I recommend starting to read related work about artifact quality. We drew heavy inspiration from the fantastic work of Dr. Florian Deissenboeck on source code maintainability and Dr. Henning Femmer, who translated this work into the domain of requirements engineering.</p>

</ol>

<p>These three papers inspired us to further develop the notion of <b>activity-based artifact quality</b> into a set of theories that define what requirements quality actually is. Simply put, the quality of a requirements artifact <i>depends on its impact on subsequent activities in which the artifact is used</i>, i.e., how well the requirements artifact fulfills its purpose. We formulated this in the requirements quality theory (RQT) and established taxonomies for both the dependent variables (i.e., the properties of requirements artifacts) and the independent variables (i.e., the properties of affected activities) of this relationship.</p>

<p>Consider these three theoreties as the foundation of the activity-based paradigm of requirements quality. Empirical research subscribing to this paradigm effectively propel a scientific understanding of requirements quality. The following two publications demonstrate how this can look.</p>

<p>We encourage both scrutinizing the theoretical foundation of requirements quality and also contributing further empirical studies subscribing to it. The initiative has further produced resources like the online <a href="http://reqfactoront.com" target="_blank">requirements quality factor ontology</a> that shall engaging with it.</p>

<h2>Causality in Requirements Artifacts</h2>

<p>In the early years of my Ph.D. I had the pleasure to support Dr. Jannik Fischbach in his doctoral studies about the use of causal statements in requirements artifacts. In a series of empirical studies we were able to show that causal statements are prevalent in requirements artifacts, their interpretation is challenging, but automatic tools can be effectively leveraged to automatically derive test cases from them.</p>

<h2>Software Engineering Research Methodology</h2>

<p>I have recently developed an interest in methods for empirical methods and data analysis in software engineering research. Particularly, I am interested in proper statistical causal inference using structural causal modeling, directed acyclic graphs, and Bayesian data analysis.
